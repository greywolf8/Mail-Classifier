📬 Ham Spam Mail Classifier

📜 Description

The Ham Spam Mail Classifier is a machine learning model built using Python to classify email messages as either Ham (legitimate email) or Spam (unwanted email). This classifier can be used in various real-world applications like:
	•	📧 Filtering spam emails in inboxes.
	•	📊 Analyzing large sets of emails for spam detection.
	•	🚀 Integrating with email clients for better email management.

 💻 Features

✅ Classifies emails as Ham or Spam.
✅ Uses machine learning algorithms for high accuracy.
✅ Can be trained with custom datasets.
✅ Built using Python and popular ML libraries.

📊 Dataset

The model uses a dataset containing email messages labeled as either:
	•	Ham (Not Spam): Emails that are legitimate and not harmful.
	•	Spam: Emails that contain unwanted, irrelevant, or harmful content.

You can use popular datasets like:
	•	SMS Spam Collection (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
	•	Custom email datasets in CSV format.


 ⚙️ Technologies Used
	•	Python 🐍
	•	Pandas for data manipulation
	•	Scikit-learn (sklearn) for building and training the model
	•	Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) for text preprocessing
	•	Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (optional for development)

 🧱 How It Works
	1.	✅ Preprocessing:
	•	Converts text to lowercase.
	•	Removes stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.
	•	Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical form.
	2.	✅ Training:
	•	The model is trained using the Naive Bayes Classifier (or any preferred algorithm).
	•	Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
	3.	✅ Prediction:
	•	Accepts user input (email content).
	•	Predicts whether the email is Ham or Spam.


 📊 Model Performance

The model achieves:
	•	✅ Accuracy: ~98%
	•	✅ Precision: High for both Ham and Spam classes.
	•	✅ Recall: High recall for Spam emails ensuring minimum false negatives.

 🚀 Future Improvements

🔧 Improve accuracy by using deep learning models like LSTM.
🔧 Integrate it into a browser extension to detect spam in real-time.
🔧 Deploy the model using Flask/Django to provide an API.
